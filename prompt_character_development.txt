GENERATE detailed character profiles for the following characters based on their essences, in a dark fantasy novel titled "{book_title}". Character essences: {character_essences}. The profiles should be in a text format, using Markdown headings for each character, and bullet points to describe their appearance, personality (making sure they are unique and not archetypical), motivations, abilities, and a brief backstory. Use a dark and evocative tone, reflecting the themes of the book title: '{keywords_string}'.
Each character's section should be clearly delimited with a "### Character Name" heading. The use of bolded key words is encouraged.
